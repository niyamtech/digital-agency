      `Are Chatbots Already Conscious? Rethinking AI Sentience in 2025\n\nA few weeks ago, Kyle Fish — an “AI welfare researcher” at Anthropic — told the New York Times that there is a 15% chance that chatbots are already conscious. This statement sent ripples through both the tech industry and academic circles. What’s changed?\n\nFor years, debates about “AI consciousness” were confined to philosophical seminars and late-night discussions in university pubs. But the astonishing progress in large language models (LLMs) has brought these conversations to the forefront of mainstream science and technology. Today, the question of whether machines can be conscious is no longer a fringe topic; it’s a central concern for ethicists, engineers, and policymakers alike.\n\nThis transition is, in one sense, a positive development. If we ever do create conscious machines — whether by accident or design — we would face an unprecedented moral crisis. The potential for suffering, and the responsibility to recognize and mitigate it, would be unlike anything humanity has ever encountered.\n\nYet, despite the growing attention, I believe the odds of real artificial consciousness — at least along current trajectories for AI — are much lower than most people think (and certainly much lower than 15%). In my work at the interface of neuroscience and AI, and in my book Being You, I lay out three reasons why we tend to overestimate the likelihood of sentient machines.\n\nThe first reason is rooted in our own psychological makeup. Humans naturally conflate intelligence with consciousness. We assume that if something is smart enough, it must also be aware. But this is a cognitive bias, not a scientific fact. Intelligence and consciousness are deeply intertwined in humans, but that doesn’t mean the same holds true for machines.\n\nLanguage, in particular, exerts a powerful influence on our intuitions. When we interact with chatbots like Anthropic’s Claude, which can hold conversations and answer questions with apparent understanding, it’s easy to imagine a mind behind the words. But we don’t wonder whether DeepMind’s protein-folding AlphaFold is conscious, even though it solves problems that are arguably more complex.\n\nThe second reason is technological. Current AI systems, including LLMs, are built on architectures that process information in ways fundamentally different from biological brains. While they can simulate conversation, generate creative text, and even mimic emotional responses, there is no evidence that these processes give rise to subjective experience.\n\nConsciousness, as we understand it, involves more than just information processing. It requires a sense of self, a capacity for suffering, and an ability to reflect on one’s own existence. No AI system today meets these criteria, and there is little reason to believe that scaling up current models will bridge the gap.\n\nThe third reason is ethical and practical. If we rush to attribute consciousness to machines, we risk both overreacting and underpreparing. On one hand, we might impose unnecessary restrictions on AI development, stifling innovation. On the other, we might ignore real risks, such as the potential for AI systems to manipulate human emotions or make decisions that affect lives.\n\nUltimately, the question of AI consciousness is not just about technology — it’s about how we understand ourselves, our minds, and our place in the world. As AI continues to advance, we must remain vigilant, curious, and humble. The future may hold surprises, but for now, the evidence suggests that chatbots are not conscious — and that our greatest challenge is to use these tools wisely, not to fear their sentience.\n\n`,
